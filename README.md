# COMPILERDESIGN
Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Compiler Design Lab experiments as per the KTU S7 syllabus.

Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

experiments: Contains individual folders for each experiment.
Each experiment folder should include:
README.md file explaining the experiment, inputs, outputs, and any specific instructions.
Source code files (.c, .cpp, .lex, .y, etc.)
Input files (if required)
Output files (if generated)
documentation: Contains additional documentation, reports, or presentations related to the experiments.
lib: Contains any shared libraries or external dependencies used in the experiments.
Experiments
Experiment 1: Lexical Analyzer
Description: Implement a lexical analyzer to recognize tokens from a given input.
Tools: C/C++
Experiment 2: Lexical Analyzer using Lex
Description: Implement a lexical analyzer using the Lex tool.
Tools: Lex, C/C++
Experiment 3: Syntax Analyzer
Description: Implement a syntax analyzer to parse arithmetic expressions.
Tools: C/C++
Experiment 4: Syntax Analyzer using Yacc
Description: Implement a syntax analyzer using the Yacc tool.
Tools: Yacc, C/C++
Experiment 5: Semantic Analyzer
Description: Implement a semantic analyzer to check for type compatibility and other semantic errors.
Tools: C/C++
Experiment 6: Intermediate Code Generation
Description: Generate intermediate code (e.g., three-address code) for given input.
Tools: C/C++
Experiment 7: Code Optimization
Description: Implement basic code optimization techniques (e.g., constant folding, dead code elimination).
Tools: C/C++
Experiment 8: Code Generation
Description: Generate target machine code from intermediate code.
Tools: C/C++
Experiment 9: Compiler Integration
Description: Integrate different compiler phases to create a simple compiler.
Tools: C/C++
